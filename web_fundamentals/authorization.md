# Authorization

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the identity of a user or device. It is an important aspect of security in software development, as it helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information or functionality.

## Types of authorization

- **Role-based authorization**: Role-based authorization grants or denies access to resources based on the role or permissions of the user. For example, an administrator might have access to all resources, while a regular user might only have access to certain resources.

- **Attribute-based authorization**: Attribute-based authorization grants or denies access to resources based on the attributes of the user or the resource itself. For example, a user might only be able to access resources that are owned by them or that are located in a certain location.

## Implementing authorization in software

- **Hard-coded permissions**: One option is to hard-code the permissions for each user or role into the application. This is simple to implement, but it is inflexible and requires the application to be redeployed every time the permissions need to be changed.

- **Database-driven permissions**: Another option is to store the permissions for each user or role in a database and look up the permissions when a request is made. This is more flexible than hard-coded permissions, but it requires the application to make a database query every time a request is made, which can be slower.

- **API-driven permissions**: Another option is to use an API to handle the authorization process. This allows the application to offload the authorization logic to a separate service, which can be more efficient and scalable.

## Best practices for authorization

Here are some best practices for implementing authorization in software:

- **Use attribute-based and role-based authorization**: Use attribute-based authorization in conjunction with role-based authorization to further restrict access to resources.

- **Implement least privilege**: Implement the principle of least privilege, which states that users should only have access to the resources that they need to perform their duties. This helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- **Use access control lists**: Use access control lists (ACLs) to specify the permissions for each user or role. This allows for fine-grained control over access to resources.
